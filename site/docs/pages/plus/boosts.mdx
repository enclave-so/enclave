# Boosts

Boosts let you show appreciation to users by unlocking special features in their wallet. When users connect their wallet to your app, they will see a "Boosted by" section that redirects them to the booster dApp, increasing user retention.

Example of "Boosted by" section:

The "Boosted by you" section remains until the user connects to a different dApp with a Plus subscription.

## How to Activate Boosts
Currently, this feature is experimental and enabled manually. To activate it for your app, please email (dan@enclave.so) or message me on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/459996160506068992).
