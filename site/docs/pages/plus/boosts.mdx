# Boosts

When users connect their wallet to your app, they will see a "Boosted by" section in their wallets that redirects them to the booster dApp, increasing user retention.

Example of the "Boosted by" section:

The "Boosted by you" section remains until the user connects to a different dApp with a Plus subscription.
